# Exercises-python
This repo contains short programming exrecises in Python: some are my solutions to Codewars katas 
(my profile: https://www.codewars.com/users/piotrbrendan), some are my implementation of common basic programming problems
and algorithms (few sorting algorithms implementations). 

Apart from that there are some exercises from Coursera courses: 
Learn to Program: the Fundamentals (University of Toronto),
Crafting Quality Code (University of Toronto)

This repo will be developed over time.
